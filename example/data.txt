# Define endpoints in a text file.

# Comments need to start on a new line with a # sign.

# Blank lines are ignored, it's better to have some of those for formatting

# An endpoint definition begins with a line containing nothing but a URL, but only path and query params will be used
# This allows us to copy any URL from the Network tab of browser's dev tool.
https://domain-is-not-used.com:8080/api/v1/whoami
# Response is kind of free format, it will be responded with 'application/json' type if it's a valid JSON, otherwise it'll be 'text/plain'.
{"name":"Ralph","isThatAll":true}

# Let's have another endpoint
https://alreayd-know-domain-is-ignored.com/api/v1/visitor
# We can define this endpoint to be of POST method, or other HTTP method
POST
# it could return something other than success (200)
503
# with a text response
Sorry, we are closed.

# Since only path and query params are checked, we can start an endpoint with just that
/api/v1/reservation/1
PUT
# We can simulate a little delay, maybe we want to see that fancy spinner in browser
200ms-1000ms
{
  "reservationNo": 1,
  "date": "yesterday",
  "message": "Thank you for booking, your reservation just expired :("
}


# Response could be something else, like a file. Once again, content-type will be determined base on file content like before
https://not-so-good-hotel.com/api/v1/_inside
# files are resolved relative to this data.txt file
file:../package.json

# If response spans multiple lines, lines of special features like, request method, response status code, or delay, will no longer be treated specially, they become part of the response.
/api/v1/nothing_special
The first non-special line starts a response. Every, almost, line after this are part of the response.


401 # will no longer be treated as response status
POST # neither the method

# Comments will always be comments
Everything is included in response. Except comment lines and blank lines.
If you really need them, put them in a file, then use a single response line like:
file:your-file.txt

Just as we have seen, the file: response line no longer carry special meanings as well


# At last, why not have an endpoint for this file
https://not-so-bad-hotel.com/api/v1/_data.txt

# Almost forgot to mention, all lines are trimmed,
  # so leading/trailing whitespaces are not included in response, unless it's from a file
    file:data.txt
